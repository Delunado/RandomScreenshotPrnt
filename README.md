# Random Screenshots from Prnt.sc.

[Prnt.sc](https://prnt.sc/) is a website that provides tools for screen capturing. It allows you to store screenshots in it's servers, so you can share them easily. But when you upload this screenshots, they become public.

Some days ago I noticed that the web [Prnct.sc](https://prnt.sc/) stores the users screenshots using sequential keys rather than random ones. So, taking advantage of that "vulnerability", I wrote a small program that opens random screenshots from Prnt.sc. 

Just open the executable, introduce the number of screenshots you want to open, and your browser will open a tab for each image. Easy peasy!
